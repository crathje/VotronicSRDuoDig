# Get data from Votronic SR Duo Digital and Votronic MPP / MPPT solar chargers

I am using a Votronic SR 300 Duo Digital with serial no. 13v20.0121 which is not capable of connecting the Votronic bluetooth devices (supported starting with serial no. 14Vxx.xxxxx):

In my RV it is connected to a Votronic Solar Computer S 1250 (again not capable of the bluetooth stuff which started with serial no. 15V40.xxxxx):

So I tried connecting a logic analyzer and found some flanks with the smaller ones beeing 980Âµs apart which seemed to be a bit length. I added a UART analyzer with 1020baud (1 / 0.000980 = 1020) and now I was able to see some bytes without any timing errors:

To verify the voltage I attached a digital storage oscilloscope and found a pretty solid 5V level output (1 y-unit = 1V):

# Get data from Votronic MPP / MPPT solar chargers

After selling the above mentioned SR 300 Duo Digital along with the RV, I bought a Votronic MPP 430 Duo Digital for my new RV. The protocol is similar but contains e.g. the battery voltage as well which can come in quire handy. 


# Sample

Simple sketch for esp32 using hardware serial: [arduinoHardwareSerial.ino](examples/arduinoHardwareSerial/arduinoHardwareSerial.ino).

No device at hand? Try: [arduinoNoDevice.ino](examples/arduinoNoDevice/arduinoNoDevice.ino).


# Pinout of the RJ12 6p6c connector

The most relevant pins would be :
1. Serial Data
2. Solar/Main Battery +
3. 
4. GND
5. 
6.
